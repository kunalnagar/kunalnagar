### Hi. I'm Kunal (he/him) üëã

‚û°Ô∏è I work as a Senior Frontend Developer at [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) where we help automate the software delivery pipeline so developers can ship quality applications more efficiently.

Most recently, I worked at [HomeX](http://homex.com/), that allows users to seamlessly schedule home service appointments.

Before that, I was at [ScaleGrid](http://scalegrid.io/), enabling users to manage their database clusters by creating dashboards and monitoring solutions.

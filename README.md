### Hello. I'm Kunal.

I work as a Principal Software Engineer at [Okta](https://okta.com/).

Previously, I worked at [CircleCI](https://circleci.com/) where we help automate the software delivery pipeline so developers can ship quality applications more efficiently.

Before that, I was at [HomeX](https://homex.com/), that allows users to seamlessly schedule home service appointments.
